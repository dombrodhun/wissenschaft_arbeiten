  abstract = {The automated classification of texts into predefined categories has become increasingly prominent, driven by the exponential growth of digital documents and the demand for efficient organization. This paper serves as an in-depth survey of text classification and machine learning, consolidating diverse aspects of the field into a single, comprehensive resourceâ€”a rarity in the current body of literature. Few studies have achieved such breadth, and this work aims to provide a unified perspective, offering a significant contribution to researchers and the academic community. The survey examines the evolution of machine learning in text categorization (TC), highlighting its transformative advantages over manual classification, such as enhanced accuracy, reduced labor, and adaptability across domains. It delves into various TC tasks and contrasts machine learning methodologies with knowledge engineering approaches, demonstrating the strengths and flexibility of data-driven techniques. Key applications of TC are explored, alongside an analysis of critical machine learning methods, including document representation techniques and dimensionality reduction strategies. Moreover, this study evaluates a range of text categorization models, identifies persistent challenges like class imbalance and overfitting, and investigates emerging trends shaping the future of the field. It discusses essential components such as document representation, classifier construction, and performance evaluation, offering a well-rounded understanding of the current state of TC. Importantly, this paper also provides clear research directions, emphasizing areas requiring further innovation, such as hybrid methodologies, explainable AI (XAI), and scalable approaches for low-resource languages. By bridging gaps in existing knowledge and suggesting actionable paths forward, this work positions itself as a vital resource for academics and industry practitioners, fostering deeper exploration and development in text classification.},

  abstract = {New business models underpinned by new standards of openness, flexibility, and agility are arising in the banking sector. Therefore, banks have to establish new strategies to keep and to extend their client base, especially with the explosive growth of customers' data and interaction touch-points. Hence, banks and fintechs are in fierce competition to transform customers' data that incorporate their transactions into pertinent and significant knowledge for decision making. In this article, we present a novel system aimed toward solving a long-standing and challenging issue: obtaining classifiers to automatically categorize bank transactions for a Smart Budget Manager. We fit and test our system using real data. The strength of our system lies in the novel combination of incremental machine learning algorithms with a natural language understanding for a fine-grained categorization of bank transactions. Our system serves as a base layer for other advanced banking applications such as segmentation, next best offers and credit scoring. Our system is deployed in a real banking application of a Tunisian bank and has shown bank and customer's satisfaction.},

This is done by means of bug reports, i.e., textual descriptions reporting the problem and the steps that led to a failure. In past and recent years, the research community deeply investigated methods for easing bug triage, that is, the process of assigning the fixing of a reported bug to the most qualified developer. Nevertheless, only a few studies have reported on how to support developers in the process of understanding the type of a reported bug, which is the first and most time-consuming step to perform before assigning a bug-fix operation. In this paper, we target this problem in two ways: first, we analyze 1280 bug reports of 119 popular projects belonging to three ecosystems such as Mozilla, Apache, and Eclipse, with the aim of building a taxonomy of the types of reported bugs; then, we devise and evaluate an automated classification model able to classify reported bugs according to the defined taxonomy. As a result, we found nine main common bug types over the considered systems. Moreover, our model achieves high F-Measure and AUC-ROC (64\% and 74\% on overall, respectively).},

  abstract = {Objective Secure messaging through patient portals is an increasingly popular way that consumers interact with healthcare providers. The increasing burden of secure messaging can affect clinic staffing and workflows. Manual management of portal messages is costly and time consuming. Automated classification of portal messages could potentially expedite message triage and delivery of care. Materials and methods We developed automated patient portal message classifiers with rule-based and machine learning techniques using bag of words and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. To evaluate classifier performance, we used a gold standard of 3253 portal messages manually categorized using a taxonomy of communication types (i.e., main categories of informational, medical, logistical, social, and other communications, and subcategories including prescriptions, appointments, problems, tests, follow-up, contact information, and acknowledgement). We evaluated our classifiersâ€™ accuracies in identifying individual communication types within portal messages with area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC). Portal messages often contain more than one type of communication. To predict all communication types within single messages, we used the Jaccard Index. We extracted the variables of importance for the random forest classifiers. Results The best performing approaches to classification for the major communication types were: logistic regression for medical communications (AUC: 0.899); basic (rule-based) for informational communications (AUC: 0.842); and random forests for social communications and logistical communications (AUCs: 0.875 and 0.925, respectively). The best performing classification approach of classifiers for individual communication subtypes was random forests for Logistical-Contact Information (AUC: 0.963). The Jaccard Indices by approach were: basic classifier, Jaccard Index: 0.674; NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Jaccard Index: 0.799; random forests, Jaccard Index: 0.859; and logistic regression, Jaccard Index: 0.861. For medical communications, the most predictive variables were NLP concepts (e.g., Temporal\_Concept, which maps to â€˜morningâ€™, â€˜eveningâ€™ and Idea\_or\_Concept which maps to â€˜appointmentâ€™ and â€˜refillâ€™). For logistical communications, the most predictive variables contained similar numbers of NLP variables and words (e.g., Telephone mapping to â€˜phoneâ€™, â€˜insuranceâ€™). For social and informational communications, the most predictive variables were words (e.g., social: â€˜thanksâ€™, â€˜muchâ€™, informational: â€˜questionâ€™, â€˜meanâ€™). Conclusions This study applies automated classification methods to the content of patient portal messages and evaluates the application of NLP techniques on consumer communications in patient portal messages. We demonstrated that random forest and logistic regression approaches accurately classified the content of portal messages, although the best approach to classification varied by communication type. Words were the most predictive variables for classification of most communication types, although NLP variables were most predictive for medical communication types. As adoption of patient portals increases, automated techniques could assist in understanding and managing growing volumes of messages. Further work is needed to improve classification performance to potentially support message triage and answering.},

However, information in short texts is often insufficient, due, for example, to the use of mnemonics, which makes them hard to classify. Therefore, the particularities of specific domains must be exploited. In this article we describe a novel system that combines Natural Language Processing techniques with Machine Learning algorithms to classify banking transaction descriptions for personal finance management, a problem that was not previously considered in the literature. We trained and tested that system on a labelled dataset with real customer transactions that will be available to other researchers on request. Motivated by existing solutions in spam detection, we also propose a short text similarity detector to reduce training set size based on the Jaccard distance. Experimental results with a two-stage classifier combining this detector with a SVM indicate a high accuracy in comparison with alternative approaches, taking into account complexity and computing time. Finally, we present a use case with a personal finance application, CoinScrap, which is available at Google Play and App Store.},

This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development.

And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain unaddressed especially in the banking sector. In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction classification system with a focus on the french market and french language text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus (Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) for code have gained significant attention recently. They can generate code in different programming languages based on provided prompts, fulfilling a long-lasting dream in Software Engineering (SE), i.e., automatic code generation. Similar to human-written code, LLM-generated code is prone to bugs, and these bugs have not yet been thoroughly examined by the community. Given the increasing adoption of LLM-based code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) in SE activities, it is critical to understand the characteristics of bugs contained in code generated by LLMs. This paper examines samples of 333 bugs collected from code generated using three leading LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and Codex) and identifies the following 10 distinctive bug patterns: Misinterpretations, Syntax Error, Silly Mistake, Prompt-biased code, Missing Corner Case, Wrong Input Type, Hallucinated Object, Wrong Attribute, Incomplete Generation, and Non-Prompted Consideration. The bug patterns are presented in the form of a taxonomy. The identified bug patterns are validated using online surveys with over 50 LLM practitioners and researchers. The surveyed participants generally asserted the significance and prevalence of the bug patterns. Researchers and practitioners can leverage these findings to develop effective quality assurance techniques for LLM-generated code. This study sheds light on the distinctive characteristics of LLM-generated code.},

  abstract = {Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) tools have proved beneficial to writing development. Research on AWE methods is essential for improving tool performance and further comparative studies are needed as new methods emerge. This study examines the performance of several AWE approaches, comparing rule-based and statistical methods, machine learning (ML) models, and a large language model (LLM). These three AWE methods were applied to a representative sample of academic essays from the TOEFL11 dataset to compare their assessment performance. Results show that the selected LLM, GPT-4, outperformed the other two approaches in terms of QWK and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, while the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in the ML approach had the highest accuracy and the lowest mean absolute error. This paper provides a detailed comparison of these three approaches and discusses implications for educational practice and future research around AWE.},
